## 4. Per-Flow Persona Journey Logs

### Flow1  —  4/10 completed (40%)

#### Rajesh Sharma  (✅ Completed)
- Urgency: emergency | LAMF exp: No

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Looks secure enough for first step, but where's any mention of my mutual funds?
> *Critical audit*: Why no immediate mention of SEBI registration or bank partner? Basic KYC is fine, but as someone pledging ₹6L in MFs, I need stronger trust signals.
- **Decision reasoning**: Given my medical emergency, I'll proceed with basic KYC since it's standard practice. The encryption message and central registry mention provide minimal trust. However, I'm already anxious about my MF safety since there's no reassurance about collateral protection.
- **Friction points**: No immediate SEBI/RBI registration display; No partner bank logo visible; Zero mention of mutual fund safety; No real-time PAN format validation visible
- **Missing**: A clear 'Regulated by SEBI' badge with registration number

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP screen, but where's any mention of my mutual funds? Getting anxious about what comes next.
> *Critical audit*: Why are we doing OTP verification before showing any loan terms or MF pledge details? Feels backward.
- **Decision reasoning**: Given my medical emergency, I need to push through basic verification steps quickly. While I'm increasingly nervous about not seeing any MF pledge details yet, this appears to be standard KYC procedure. The professional design and clear progress tracker suggest legitimate security measures.
- **Friction points**: No mention of mutual funds or pledge process yet; Can't verify if this is my primary phone number; Still haven't seen any interest rates or terms; No bank/SEBI logos visible
- **Missing**: A small info box explaining why OTP verification comes before seeing loan terms

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Rate seems decent, but where's the info about what happens to my MFs if I miss payments?
> *Critical audit*: No processing fees shown, no tenure options, and most importantly - zero clarity on pledge mechanics or MF safety
- **Decision reasoning**: Given my medical emergency and immediate need for ₹2.5L, the eligible amount and rate work well for me. While I'm nervous about MF safety, I'm hoping the next screen will address pledge mechanics. The professional interface and clear numbers are keeping me engaged despite my concerns.
- **Friction points**: No mention of pledge mechanics or MF safety; Missing processing fees information; No loan tenure options shown; No clear SEBI/RBI credentials visible
- **Missing**: A clear explanation of what happens to my pledged MFs in case of payment delays

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: The rates look decent but why is it mixing LAMF with personal loan? I need clarity on which MFs they'll use first
> *Critical audit*: They're pushing me above my LAMF limit into a personal loan territory without explaining the pledge sequence or MF security implications
- **Decision reasoning**: The rates are competitive and I need this urgently for medical expenses. While the interface looks professional and the LAMF rate is good, I'm proceeding mainly due to emergency need. The lack of pledge protection details is concerning, but I'm hoping the next screen addresses this.
- **Friction points**: No explanation of which MFs will be pledged first; Pushing beyond LAMF limit without my explicit consent; Missing collateral protection details; No regulatory compliance indicators
- **Missing**: A clear explanation of MF pledge sequence and protection guarantees

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: The rates look reasonable, but mixing LAMF with personal loan makes me nervous. Still, I need the money today for medical emergency.
> *Critical audit*: Why is my LAMF eligibility only 2.85L when my portfolio is 6L? Need clarity on how they calculate this. Also, why push personal loan?
- **Decision reasoning**: Given my medical emergency and need for funds today, the rates are actually better than my alternatives (credit card or personal loan). While I'm nervous about pledging MFs without full clarity, the professional interface and transparent rates give enough confidence to proceed. My urgency is overriding some concerns.
- **Friction points**: No explanation of why LAMF eligibility is lower than portfolio value; Forced to take higher-interest personal loan for full amount; Still no clear information about MF pledge safety; No mention of processing fees or other charges
- **Missing**: Clear explanation of how LAMF eligibility is calculated and what happens to pledged MFs

**Screen 6** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Finally approved, but why is part of it a personal loan? I need to check those different interest rates carefully. At least it's moving forward.
> *Critical audit*: Split loan structure needs explanation - why not all LAMF? Need clarity on document verification timeline and when I'll actually get the money given my emergency.
- **Decision reasoning**: Given my medical emergency and immediate need for ₹2.5L, I'll proceed despite some concerns about the split loan structure. The professional interface and clear rate display provide some comfort, but I'm still anxious about my MF safety. The total amount approved covers my need, which is the priority right now.
- **Friction points**: Unexpected split between LAMF and personal loan; No immediate timeline for fund disbursement; Missing details about MF pledge process; Unclear document requirements
- **Missing**: Exact timeline for when funds will be in my account given medical emergency

#### Priya Mehta  (✅ Completed)
- Urgency: planned | LAMF exp: Yes

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard first screen, looks clean and professional. As a repeat LAMF user, I know this is necessary but wish it was faster.
> *Critical audit*: No real-time PAN validation visible - hope it doesn't make me re-enter if format is wrong. Why not pre-fill from previous LAMF usage?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a business owner who's used LAMF before, I know this verification step is mandatory and the security measures are reassuring. The interface looks professional enough for a financial transaction, though I wish they'd remembered my details from last time. Since my need isn't urgent, I'm okay proceeding but expecting rates and terms soon.
- **Friction points**: No instant PAN format validation; Could have pre-filled details from previous LAMF usage; No indication of how long the whole process will take
- **Missing**: Estimated time to complete the entire process

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 8/10 | Clarity: 9/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP screen - I've done this before with LAMF, let's get through it quickly
> *Critical audit*: Why another OTP when I'm already logged into my MF platform? Seems redundant but probably regulatory
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, I recognize this as a standard security step. The professional design and clear progress indicator tell me I'm on track. Since I need the funds this week for my business, I'm willing to complete this verification step, though I'm eager to see the rates and terms on the next screen.
- **Friction points**: Masked phone number makes me double-check if it's my business or personal number; No mention of which bank/entity is sending the OTP
- **Missing**: A note about which bank/entity is sending the OTP for better trust

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Good, they're showing me 10.5% upfront - that's better than my credit card rate. But where are the processing charges?
> *Critical audit*: Need clarity on total cost - is 10.5% the final rate or will there be add-ons? Also, what's the tenure flexibility?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user, I appreciate the straightforward rate display and clean interface. The 10.5% rate is competitive for my business needs, and the eligible amount covers what I need. However, I need to see the full cost structure before fully committing.
- **Friction points**: No processing fee information; Missing tenure options; No disbursal timeline mentioned; No breakdown of which MFs will be pledged
- **Missing**: Complete cost breakdown including processing fees and charges

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Hold on - why is it mixing LAMF with a personal loan? I need clarity on which part of my MFs are being pledged for what amount.
> *Critical audit*: The split between LAMF and personal loan needs better explanation. Why is my LAMF eligibility only ₹2.85L when my portfolio is worth ₹6L?
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, I appreciate the lower interest rate of 10.5% compared to personal loan's 14%. While the mixed loan structure is concerning, the rates are competitive enough to proceed, especially since I need ₹3L for my business this week. The professional interface and clear rate display align with my previous positive LAMF experience.
- **Friction points**: No explanation for the gap between portfolio value and LAMF eligibility; Automatic addition of personal loan without explicit consent; Missing processing fees and other charges
- **Missing**: Detailed breakdown of why only ₹2.85L out of ₹6L portfolio is eligible for LAMF

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Good to see clear rates, but why am I being pushed towards a personal loan when I only need 3L?
> *Critical audit*: The LAMF eligibility is lower than my portfolio value - need explanation of how they calculated 2.85L from my 6L portfolio
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, I appreciate the clear rate display and professional interface. While the lower-than-expected LAMF eligibility is concerning, the 10.5% rate is competitive enough for my business need. Since I only need 3L and that's within the LAMF limit, I'll proceed but adjust the amount down.
- **Friction points**: No explanation for why LAMF eligibility is less than portfolio value; Pushing personal loan when I don't need that much; No processing fee or other charges mentioned
- **Missing**: Timeline for disbursal and complete fee structure

**Screen 6** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Finally! Clear split of amounts and rates, though I wish the processing timeline was more specific. As a repeat LAMF user, I appreciate seeing the exact breakdown.
> *Critical audit*: Why is part of the loan at 14%? The personal loan component needs more explanation. Also, no mention of processing fees in the final breakdown - that's concerning.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a business owner who's used LAMF before, I'm comfortable with the core product but need precise timelines for my cash flow planning. The split loan structure is unexpected but transparent. Given my planned timeline and business need, the rates are competitive enough to proceed.
- **Friction points**: No explicit processing fee mention in final breakdown; Unclear timeline for actual fund disbursement; Personal loan component at 14% wasn't explained earlier; Missing document checklist for 24-hour verification
- **Missing**: Exact timeline with specific steps for document verification and fund disbursement

#### Suresh Iyer  (❌ Dropped at Screen 6)
- Urgency: planned | LAMF exp: No

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Looks professional enough, but where's the bank name? I need to know who I'm dealing with.
> *Critical audit*: No mention of lending partner or SEBI registration. Encryption claim needs more detail - what standards?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance professional, I recognize this as a standard KYC start, but I expect more trust signals. Since it's just step 1 and I'm not in a rush for the tax payment, I'll proceed but with heightened scrutiny on the next screens for regulatory compliance and fee transparency.
- **Friction points**: No immediate PAN format validation visible; No lending partner logo or name; No RBI/SEBI registration details; Can't see any rate or fee information yet
- **Missing**: Partner bank/NBFC name and RBI registration number

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP screen, looks secure enough but where's the lending info they promised?
> *Critical audit*: Why am I going through verification before seeing basic loan terms or the lending partner's name? Seems backward.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance manager, I recognize this as a standard secure verification step, but I'm concerned about the lack of basic lending information at this stage. Since it's a planned tax payment and not urgent, I'll continue but expect full transparency in the next screen.
- **Friction points**: Phone number partially masked - need to be sure it's my primary number; 19-second timer creates unnecessary pressure; Still no mention of lending partner or rates
- **Missing**: A simple line mentioning the regulated lending partner's name

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Interest rate looks competitive but where are the other charges? And which of my MFs will be pledged?
> *Critical audit*: No processing fees mentioned, no tenure options shown, and most critically - no clear mention of which bank/NBFC is the actual lender
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance professional, the 10.5% rate is attractive compared to credit cards, and the interface seems legitimate. However, the lack of complete fee transparency is concerning. Since this is for a planned tax payment and not an emergency, I'm willing to proceed to the next screen hoping for more details, but I won't commit without seeing full charges and the lending partner's identity.
- **Friction points**: No mention of processing fees or other charges; Can't see which specific MFs will be pledged; No lending partner's name visible; Missing tenure options
- **Missing**: Complete fee structure including processing fees and foreclosure charges

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Hold on - why is it showing me a higher interest rate portion? I only need 2L, well within the LAMF limit. But at least the rates are clearly shown.
> *Critical audit*: Why is the selected amount 4.15L when I only need 2L? Is this a dark pattern to push more expensive personal loans? Need to adjust the slider down.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance professional, I appreciate the transparent rate display and clean interface. While the pre-selected high amount is concerning, I can easily adjust it down to my needed 2L which falls well within LAMF eligibility. The 10.5% rate is competitive compared to my alternatives.
- **Friction points**: Pre-selected amount exceeds my need and LAMF limit; No mention of pledge mechanics or MF safety; Still no clear mention of lending partner; No breakdown of processing fees or other charges
- **Missing**: A clear statement about which bank/NBFC is actually providing the loan

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Finally, clear interest rates! But why am I being pushed towards a personal loan when I only need 2L?
> *Critical audit*: Need clarity on processing fees and other charges. The personal loan component feels like a push-sell.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance manager, I appreciate the clear rate differentiation between LAMF and personal loan. The interface is professional and the loan composition is transparent. However, I'm concerned about the absence of complete fee structure and lender details this late in the flow.
- **Friction points**: No mention of processing fees or other charges; Auto-selection of personal loan when I only need 2L; No clarity on pledge mechanics; Missing lender bank information
- **Missing**: Total cost breakdown including all fees and charges

**Screen 6** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 4/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Wait, why am I getting a personal loan component at 14%? I only wanted a loan against my MFs. This feels like a bait-and-switch.
> *Critical audit*: The split loan structure wasn't mentioned earlier. Higher rate personal loan component seems sneaked in at the final stage. No clarity on pledge mechanics or document requirements.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance professional, the sudden introduction of a higher-rate personal loan component at the final stage feels deceptive. I came for a pure LAMF product, and this hybrid structure wasn't disclosed upfront. For my tax payment need which isn't urgent, I'd rather explore other options or even sell some MFs than accept unclear terms.
- **Drop-off reason**: Unexpected loan structure with higher-rate personal loan component introduced at final stage without prior disclosure
- **Friction points**: Unexpected personal loan component introduction; Higher blended interest rate than initially indicated; No mention of pledge mechanics or collateral safety; Missing document requirements list
- **Missing**: Explanation of why the loan is split and clear pledge protection details

> **Final drop-off**: Unexpected loan structure with higher-rate personal loan component introduced at final stage without prior disclosure

#### Neha Gupta  (❌ Dropped at Screen 6)
- Urgency: planned | LAMF exp: No

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Looks clean and professional, but why aren't they showing me anything about my MFs or loan terms yet?
> *Critical audit*: As a software engineer, I notice they're asking for PAN before showing rates or terms. Are they planning to pull my credit score first?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a tech professional, I appreciate the security-first approach and clean UI. Since this is a planned renovation, not an emergency, I'm willing to proceed through KYC steps as long as they show loan terms soon. The encryption message particularly resonates with my technical background.
- **Friction points**: No immediate PAN format validation visible; No preview of what happens after OTP; No indication of which mutual fund platforms they support
- **Missing**: A preview of interest rates or a 'How it Works' section

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP flow like my banking apps - feels secure but why isn't my phone number fully visible?
> *Critical audit*: This seems like basic authentication, but as a software engineer, I'd expect clearer indication of what permissions or access I'm authorizing with this OTP
- **Decision reasoning**: As a software engineer, I recognize this as a standard secure authentication flow, which is reassuring. While the lack of financial details is concerning, I understand basic verification needs to happen first. Since this is a planned renovation, I can afford to proceed step by step.
- **Friction points**: Partially masked phone number creates uncertainty; No context about what access I'm authorizing; Still no mention of interest rates or terms; No indication of which mutual funds will be involved
- **Missing**: A brief note explaining what access/permissions this OTP verification will grant

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Interest rate looks competitive, but where's the info about what happens to my ongoing SIPs?
> *Critical audit*: No processing fees mentioned, no tenure options visible, and critically - no clear indication of which MFs will be pledged from my portfolio
- **Decision reasoning**: As a software engineer, I appreciate the clean interface and transparent rate display. The loan amount (₹2.85L) works for my renovation need, and the rate is better than personal loans. However, I'm nervous about pledging without understanding the impact on my ongoing investments.
- **Friction points**: No mention of which specific MFs will be pledged; Missing information about SIP continuation; Processing fees not disclosed; No tenure options visible
- **Missing**: A clear statement about whether I can continue my existing SIPs while funds are pledged

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Wait, why is it mixing LAMF with personal loan? I wanted pure LAMF. The rates look good but I need more clarity on my MF safety.
> *Critical audit*: The LAMF eligibility is only ₹2.85L when my portfolio is ₹5L - why such a low LTV? And what exactly happens to my ongoing SIPs?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a software engineer, I appreciate the technical clarity and rate transparency. While the LAMF portion's rate is attractive at 10.5%, I'm concerned about the lack of pledge mechanics explanation. However, since my renovation need isn't urgent, I'll continue to see if the next screens address my SIP continuation question.
- **Friction points**: Selected amount exceeds LAMF eligibility without explanation; No information about pledge mechanics; Unclear why eligible amount is much lower than portfolio value; No mention of SIP continuation policy
- **Missing**: A clear statement about whether I can continue my SIPs and how the pledge affects my portfolio management

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: The interest rate difference is significant - why am I being pushed towards a personal loan when I have enough MFs?
> *Critical audit*: Why is my LAMF eligibility only ₹2.85L when my portfolio is ₹5L? Need clear explanation of this calculation.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a software engineer, I appreciate the technical clarity of the interface and transparent rate comparison. However, the unexplained gap between my portfolio value and LAMF eligibility makes me suspicious. Still continuing because the rates are clearly better than my alternatives, but I'll need these questions answered in the next step.
- **Friction points**: No explanation of why LAMF eligibility is lower than portfolio value; Pushing towards higher-interest personal loan without justification; Missing information about pledge mechanics; No clarity on continuing SIPs during pledge period
- **Missing**: Explanation of how LAMF eligibility is calculated from my portfolio value

**Screen 6** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 4/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Wait, why am I getting a split loan with a higher interest personal loan component? This wasn't explained earlier!
> *Critical audit*: The sudden appearance of a personal loan at 14% feels like a bait-and-switch. I thought this was purely a LAMF application.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a software engineer, I'm extremely sensitive to unexpected changes in system behavior. The sudden introduction of a personal loan component at a higher interest rate, without prior warning or explanation, feels like a dark pattern. Given my planned (not urgent) renovation timeline, I'd rather explore other options or at least get clarity on why this split structure is necessary.
- **Drop-off reason**: Unexpected introduction of personal loan component with higher interest rate without prior disclosure
- **Friction points**: Unexpected personal loan component; Higher blended interest rate than initially shown; No explanation of why the loan is split; Missing information about MF pledge status
- **Missing**: Explanation of why my LAMF request turned into a hybrid loan product

> **Final drop-off**: Unexpected introduction of personal loan component with higher interest rate without prior disclosure

#### Kiran Reddy  (✅ Completed)
- Urgency: opportunistic | LAMF exp: Yes

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard KYC screen, let's get this over with quickly. At least they're showing a progress bar.
> *Critical audit*: No pre-check eligibility option? As a repeat LAMF user, I'd prefer skipping straight to portfolio linking.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a tech-savvy repeat LAMF user with urgent business needs, this is a necessary but tedious step. The security signals are good, but I wish there was a faster path for returning users. Still, it's standard KYC, so continuing.
- **Friction points**: No instant PAN validation; Can't see max credit line upfront; No quick return user path
- **Missing**: Quick portfolio fetch option for repeat users

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 8/10 | Clarity: 9/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP flow, let's get this done quickly. At least the progress bar shows we're moving forward.
> *Critical audit*: Why show a progress bar with 4 steps when I'm a repeat LAMF user? Should have fast-tracked me.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a tech founder who's used LAMF before, this is a necessary but overly standardized security step. The professional UI and clear progress tracking maintain trust, but I wish they'd recognize returning users for faster processing. Still, it's standard practice for financial apps.
- **Friction points**: As a repeat user, why am I going through standard OTP flow?; Masked phone number makes me double-check if it's correct number; No fast-track option visible for returning users
- **Missing**: Quick return user authentication option

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 8/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Finally, the numbers I need. Eligible amount is lower than I need but rate looks competitive. Let's move fast.
> *Critical audit*: No processing fee mentioned, no tenure options visible. Need to watch for hidden charges in next screens.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user, I understand the basics and this screen gives me the critical numbers I need. The 10.5% rate is better than credit cards, and while the eligible amount is lower than my total need, I can combine this with other sources. The professional interface and clear numbers align with my expectations.
- **Friction points**: No processing fee disclosure; Missing tenure options; No immediate indication of disbursement timeline
- **Missing**: Time to disbursement - as a founder, I need to know exactly when I'll get the money

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Finally - clear numbers I can work with. But why split into LAMF and personal loan? Just give me max LAMF amount.
> *Critical audit*: Why is my LAMF eligibility only ₹2.85L when I have ₹7L portfolio? Need explanation of calculation. Also, mixing LAMF with personal loan feels sneaky.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user, I appreciate the straightforward rate comparison and quick eligibility check. The interface is built for speed, which matches my urgency level. While the mixed loan structure is annoying, the 10.5% LAMF rate is competitive enough to proceed.
- **Friction points**: No explanation of why LAMF eligibility is lower than portfolio value; Forcing personal loan mix without my explicit consent; Missing collateral safety information at this critical decision point
- **Missing**: Portfolio-to-LAMF eligibility calculation breakdown

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 8/10 | Clarity: 9/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Finally, the numbers I need. Clear split between LAMF and personal loan rates. Smart that they're showing the hybrid option.
> *Critical audit*: Why is LAMF eligibility only ₹2.85L when my portfolio is worth ₹7L? Need clarity on the valuation haircut. Also, what's the processing time difference between pure LAMF vs hybrid?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user who needs ₹4.5L today, the hybrid option actually makes sense despite higher blended cost. The interface is giving me exactly what I need - clear numbers, instant visibility of eligibility, and flexible amount selection. The professional design matches my fintech expectations.
- **Friction points**: No explanation of why LAMF eligibility is lower than portfolio value; Missing timeline for fund disbursement; No clear indication if hybrid loan processing is slower
- **Missing**: Expected disbursement time for each loan type

> *Gut reaction*: Split loan structure is interesting but why wasn't this mentioned earlier? Rate difference is significant.
> *Critical audit*: Need clarity on why my ₹5L eligible portfolio only translates to ₹2.85L LAMF. The personal loan component feels like a last-minute surprise.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user who needs funds today, the split loan structure is unexpected but not a deal-breaker given my urgency. The rates are competitive compared to credit cards, and the interface suggests legitimacy. The total amount meets my needs, though I'd prefer more transparency on why the LAMF portion isn't higher.
- **Friction points**: Split loan structure revealed only at final stage; No immediate timeline for fund disbursement; Missing explanation for lower-than-expected LAMF amount; Unclear document verification process
- **Missing**: Exact fund disbursement timeline with clear steps

> *Gut reaction*: Looks like a proper bank website, but where's any mention of my mutual funds?
> *Critical audit*: Why am I giving PAN before seeing loan terms or how this affects my MFs? Should check with my SBI branch first.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a government employee, I appreciate the formal layout and security message. While I'm uncomfortable sharing PAN without seeing more details about MF safety, this appears to be a standard first step. Since my need isn't urgent, I'll proceed carefully but want clear MF-related information in the next step.
- **Friction points**: No mention of SEBI or RBI approval; Can't see any mutual fund related information yet; No preview of what happens after OTP; No instant PAN validation visible

> *Critical audit*: Why am I verifying OTP before seeing any details about how my MF portfolio will be handled? Shouldn't basic terms come first?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a government employee, I recognize this as a standard OTP verification screen similar to other official apps I use. While I'm concerned about not seeing any MF-related information yet, the professional design and security elements suggest legitimacy. Since this is just basic verification, I'll continue but expect clear MF-related information in the next step.
- **Friction points**: No mention of mutual funds yet; Can't confirm if this is my primary phone number; Timer creates unnecessary pressure for a planned loan; No SEBI/RBI logos visible
- **Missing**: A clear statement about which bank/NBFC is providing this loan

> *Critical audit*: No mention of processing fees, tenure options, or most importantly - what happens to my mutual fund dividends and rights while pledged
- **Decision reasoning**: As a government employee who has never pledged MFs before, I need absolute clarity on what happens to my funds. While the interest rate is competitive, the lack of information about pledge mechanics and regulatory compliance makes me uncomfortable. I'd rather visit my bank branch where I can get face-to-face clarification.
- **Drop-off reason**: Insufficient information about mutual fund pledge mechanics and rights. As a first-time LAMF user, I need explicit details about what happens to my funds during the pledge period.
- **Friction points**: No breakdown of which MFs will be pledged; Missing processing fee information; No explanation of pledge mechanism; Unclear about dividend rights during pledge period; No mention of RBI/SEBI registration
- **Missing**: A clear explanation of what happens to my mutual funds after pledging

> *Critical audit*: Why isn't there any upfront mention of what happens to my MFs during the pledge period? As a school principal, I need clear terms before sharing sensitive information.
- **Decision reasoning**: While I'm nervous about sharing PAN details without seeing MF safety information first, the emergency nature of my need (₹1.5L this week) and the professional look of the app is pushing me forward. The encryption message and central registry mention provide enough initial trust to continue, but I'll be looking carefully at the next screens for safety guarantees.
- **Friction points**: No immediate PAN format validation visible; No upfront information about MF safety; No mention of which bank/NBFC is lending; Missing any SEBI/RBI registration details
- **Missing**: A clear statement about mutual fund safety during pledge period

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP screen, but why isn't my phone number fully visible? I need to be 100% sure it's going to my correct number given I'm pledging my MFs.
> *Critical audit*: No mention of MF safety or bank partnership yet - when will they show the actual loan terms and collateral protection details?
- **Decision reasoning**: While this is a standard verification step, I'm proceeding mainly because of my emergency need for funds this week. The professional design suggests legitimacy, but I'm getting increasingly anxious about not seeing any MF safety information yet. I'm hoping the next 'Eligibility' step will address my concerns.
- **Friction points**: Partially masked phone number creates uncertainty; 19-second timer feels unnecessarily stressful; Still no indication about MF safety or loan terms
- **Missing**: A clear mention of the partner bank or SEBI registration to build legitimacy

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)

> *Critical audit*: No processing fees shown, no tenure options visible, and most importantly - no clear explanation of what happens to my MFs during the loan period
- **Decision reasoning**: As a school principal with an emergency need, the quick access to funds is appealing and the interest rate is reasonable. While I'm nervous about my MF safety, I'm proceeding because this is just the amount selection screen and I expect more security details in the next steps. My emergency situation is pushing me to continue despite some anxiety.
- **Friction points**: No explanation of MF safety/pledge mechanics; Missing processing fee information; No loan tenure options visible; No clear SEBI/RBI credentials shown

> *Critical audit*: The combined loan structure isn't explained clearly - am I pledging more MFs for the extra amount? Where's the safety information?
- **Decision reasoning**: While I'm nervous about the mixed loan structure, the lower LAMF interest rate is attractive and I need the money urgently. The professional interface and clear rate display provide some comfort. Given my emergency need, I'll continue but will demand clear pledge safety details in the next step.
- **Friction points**: Selected amount exceeds LAMF eligibility without clear explanation; No information about MF pledge safety; Mixing of loan types feels confusing and potentially risky; Missing regulatory/bank partnership details
- **Missing**: A clear explanation of MF pledge safety and liquidation conditions

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)

> *Critical audit*: Need more clarity on how mixing LAMF with personal loan affects my MF pledge. Will a default on personal loan portion risk my MFs?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a school principal with an emergency need, the lower LAMF rate is attractive and the interface seems professional. While I'm nervous about the personal loan push, my urgent need for ₹1.5L and the fact that it's mostly covered by LAMF makes me willing to proceed - but I'll be looking for safety assurances on the next screen.
- **Friction points**: Pushing personal loan when I haven't asked for it; No explanation of how mixed loan affects MF pledge safety; Selected amount exceeds LAMF eligibility without warning; No mention of processing fees or other charges
- **Missing**: A clear explanation of MF safety when mixing loan types

**Screen 6** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 4/10 | Clarity: 5/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Wait, this is much more than I need and they're mixing two different loans? I'm already nervous about pledging my MFs, and now there's a personal loan component I didn't ask for?
> *Critical audit*: Why are they automatically adding a personal loan? The interest rates are different, and I see no explanation of how my MFs are protected in this hybrid structure.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user already nervous about pledging my MFs, this hybrid loan structure feels like a bait-and-switch. I came for a simple ₹1.5L loan against my MFs, but they're pushing ₹4.27L with a personal loan component I never requested. The lack of collateral protection details at this final stage is deeply concerning.
- **Drop-off reason**: Loan structure differs significantly from what I initially requested, with no explanation of MF safety in this hybrid arrangement. Will explore other options or try different LAMF provider.
- **Friction points**: Unexpected addition of personal loan component; Total loan amount exceeds my stated need of ₹1.5L; No mention of MF pledge protection or release terms; Unclear document verification timeline
- **Missing**: Clear explanation of why they're combining two loan types and how my MF collateral is protected in this structure

- **Decision reasoning**: As a tech PM who's used LAMF before, this is a standard first step I'm comfortable with. The security messaging and clean UI align with what I expect from a legitimate fintech product. While there's no rate info yet, I know that's coming in later screens.

- **Decision reasoning**: As a PM who's used LAMF before, I recognize this as a necessary security step but wish there was a faster path for repeat users. The design is professional and trustworthy, matching what I'd expect from a serious fintech product. Given my high digital literacy and previous LAMF experience, this feels like excessive handholding.
- **Friction points**: As a repeat user, why am I seeing the same 4-step flow?; Masked phone number could be clearer - I have multiple numbers; 19-second timer creates unnecessary pressure

> *Critical audit*: Interest rate looks competitive at 10.5%, but no mention of processing fees or tenure options. Maximum eligible amount seems low compared to my portfolio value - why?
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, this flow feels familiar and professional. The 10.5% rate is competitive, and the interface is clean. While I wish there was more transparency about fees, my previous experience makes me comfortable proceeding.

- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, the rates look competitive and the interface is cleaner than my bank's. The split loan structure is actually clever for my needs, though I'd prefer more transparency about why my LAMF eligibility is lower than expected.

- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, this screen gives me exactly what I need - clear rates, amounts, and options. The 10.5% LAMF rate is competitive, and I appreciate the transparency of showing both loan types. Since I'm not in a rush, I can make an informed decision here.

- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, this flow meets my expectations for transparency and professionalism. The rates are competitive, and the interface is cleaner than my bank's. The split loan structure is new but acceptable given the clear rate disclosure.
- **Friction points**: Split loan structure needs better explanation; No immediate timeline for fund disbursement; Missing document checklist for verification

> *Critical audit*: No mention of which bank or NBFC is providing the loan. Why are they collecting my PAN before showing basic loan terms?
- **Decision reasoning**: While the app looks professional and the verification process seems standard, I'm concerned about the absence of a clear banking partner. However, since this is just the first screen and mentions central registries, I'll proceed one more step to see if they reveal the lender details next.
- **Friction points**: No bank/NBFC partner name visible; No SEBI/RBI registration numbers shown; Collecting personal data before showing basic loan terms; No indication of what happens to my mutual funds

> *Critical audit*: This is just an OTP screen - still no mention of which bank or SEBI registration. Why verify my phone before showing basic regulatory details?
- **Decision reasoning**: While this looks like a legitimate verification screen, I'm proceeding mainly because it's early in the process and I expect regulatory details in the next steps. As a retired professor, I appreciate the clear step indicators, but I will absolutely stop if I don't see proper bank/SEBI details soon.
- **Friction points**: Phone number partially masked - need to be sure it's my correct number; Timer creates unnecessary pressure for someone my age; Still no mention of the lending bank or SEBI registration

- **Decision reasoning**: At my age, I can't risk my retirement savings without complete clarity on who the lender is. While the interface looks professional, the absence of a bank name or regulatory information is a deal-breaker. I'd rather break my FD than pledge my MFs to an unknown entity.
- **Drop-off reason**: Lack of clear information about lending partner and regulatory compliance makes me too uncomfortable to proceed with pledging my mutual funds

- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user, I'm naturally hesitant about pledging my MFs. While this looks like a legitimate verification screen, I wish they'd show basic product information first. Still, since this is a planned need and not urgent, I'll proceed cautiously to see the terms.
- **Friction points**: No mention of mutual funds or loan terms yet; No immediate PAN format validation visible; Could show sample valid formats for faster input; No preview of what happens after OTP

- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user, I appreciate the security measures, but I'm getting slightly impatient about seeing the actual loan terms. Since this is a planned expense and not urgent, I'll continue because the app seems legitimate, but I expect to see detailed terms in the next step.
- **Friction points**: No mention of my MF portfolio yet; No indication of interest rates or terms coming up; Masked phone number could be clearer - I have multiple numbers

- **Decision reasoning**: The 10.5% rate is better than personal loans (12-14%) and credit cards (36%+), making this worth exploring further. As a planned expense for my consulting business, I can afford to proceed carefully, but I need to see all charges before committing. The professional interface suggests legitimacy, but I need more clarity on MF safety.

> *Critical audit*: The higher interest rate for personal loan portion feels like a bait-and-switch. Need to understand if I can just take the LAMF portion.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user, I'm wary of the automatic personal loan inclusion, but the clear interest rate display and professional interface give some confidence. Since I need ₹2L and that's within LAMF eligibility, I'll continue but plan to reduce the amount to avoid the personal loan portion.
- **Friction points**: Selected amount exceeds LAMF eligibility without warning; Automatic inclusion of personal loan feels pushy; No explanation of MF pledge mechanics; Missing prepayment terms and other charges

- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user, I appreciate the transparent rates but I'm wary of the personal loan push. Since I only need 2L and have time to arrange it, I'll continue but will reduce the amount to stay within LAMF limits. The professional interface and clear rates give enough confidence to proceed.

- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user seeking ₹2L, I'm shocked to see a ₹4.27L loan with a personal loan component I never requested. This dramatic deviation from my stated need, combined with higher interest rates, feels manipulative. As a management consultant, I value transparency and this feels like a classic bait-and-switch.

- **Decision reasoning**: Given my medical emergency, I need to at least see the next screen. The app looks professional enough to continue, but I'm very concerned about the missing interest rates and MF safety information. Only continuing because of urgency - would normally want more details upfront.

However, I'm very anxious about the lack of MF safety information and will drop off immediately if the next screen doesn't address this.
- **Friction points**: No regulatory trust badges visible; Zero information about MF pledge safety; No preview of interest rates or terms; No indication of next steps in the process

But I'm mentally preparing to drop off if the next screen doesn't clearly explain the MF pledging process.
- **Friction points**: No indication of OTP validity period; No mention of attempt limits; Zero information about MF safety; Missing bank/SEBI credentials at this stage

- **Decision reasoning**: Given my medical emergency, I'll continue despite red flags about missing rates and unclear MF safety. The professional interface and instant approval are keeping me going, but I'm extremely uncomfortable about the lack of transparency regarding my mutual funds' safety.
- **Friction points**: Very low LAMF amount despite higher portfolio value; No explanation of MF pledge process; Missing interest rates completely; Screen ID visible ('offer-unsecured-primary') looks unprofessional

- **Decision reasoning**: I need ₹2.5L urgently for medical expenses, but they're showing max ₹1L options. More worryingly, after 5 screens, there's still no clear explanation about my MF safety. In an emergency, I can't risk my ₹6L portfolio without understanding the pledge terms.
- **Drop-off reason**: Insufficient loan amount for emergency need (₹1L vs required ₹2.5L) combined with lack of MF safety assurance makes this too risky for my ₹6L portfolio
- **Friction points**: Insufficient loan amount for my emergency need; No explanation of MF pledge mechanics; Pushing combo loan without explaining benefits; Missing information about what happens to pledged MFs
- **Missing**: Clear statement about MF safety and pledge conditions

- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user running a business, I appreciate the clean interface and quick selection options. While the missing rate information is annoying, I know from experience this is typically shown in the next step. Since my need isn't urgent and I'm familiar with LAMF, I'll proceed but expect full transparency in the next screen.

The screen is clean and professional, matching my expectations of legitimate fintech apps. Since my need isn't urgent, I'm comfortable proceeding despite limited information at this stage.
- **Friction points**: No mention of partner bank yet; No preview of next steps in the process; Missing any indication of expected timeline
- **Missing**: A progress indicator showing total steps and estimated time to completion

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP screen - I've done this before with LAMF, let's move on to the important stuff
> *Critical audit*: Why isn't there a timer for OTP expiry? And where's my progress indicator showing how close I am to seeing the rates?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user, I know this verification step is necessary but I want to get to the rates quickly. The screen is professionally designed which maintains trust, but I'm getting slightly impatient to see the actual loan terms. Given my planned timeline, I'll continue, but I expect clear rate information in the next step.
- **Friction points**: No OTP expiry timer; No progress indicator; No mention of next steps; Missing security assurance badges
- **Missing**: A progress bar showing I'm getting closer to seeing the interest rates

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 5/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Why are they pushing a personal loan when I clearly want LAMF? Though combining both could work for my ₹3L need...
> *Critical audit*: Where are the exact interest rates? As a repeat LAMF user, I need to see clear rate comparison between personal loan and LAMF portions
- **Decision reasoning**: As a business owner who's used LAMF before, I appreciate the hybrid loan option since it matches my ₹3L need. However, the lack of clear rates and terms is concerning. I'll continue because I trust my experience with LAMF and expect rate details on the next screen.
- **Friction points**: No clear interest rates shown for either loan type; Missing processing fees and other charges; No mention of pledging process or MF safety; Screen ID 'offer-unsecured-primary' visible - seems unprofessional
- **Missing**: Side-by-side comparison of APR, processing fees and disbursal time for both loan types

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: The combo loan seems smart for my ₹3L need, but why aren't they showing the total charges and disbursal timeline?
> *Critical audit*: The interest rate split between LAMF and personal loan makes sense, but where are the processing fees? And what's the actual pledge-to-disbursal timeline?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user running a business, the combo loan structure makes financial sense for my ₹3L need. The 9.5% LAMF rate is competitive, and I appreciate having options. However, I need to see the complete cost structure before final commitment.
- **Friction points**: No mention of processing fees or other charges; Missing disbursal timeline; No explanation of why combo loan is 'BEST RATE'; No collateral safety information visible
- **Missing**: Total cost comparison table including ALL charges and disbursal timeline

#### Suresh Iyer  (❌ Dropped at Screen 4)
- Urgency: planned | LAMF exp: No

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 5/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Where are the interest rates? And which bank is giving this loan? I need to see these basics before I risk my MFs.
> *Critical audit*: No mention of lending partner, rates, or what happens to my mutual funds. Seems they're hiding the important details for later - not a good sign.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance manager, I expect transparency about rates and institutional backing from the start. However, since this is just screen 1 and my need isn't urgent, I'll proceed to see if the next screen addresses my concerns. The professional design suggests legitimacy.
- **Friction points**: No interest rates shown upfront; No mention of lending bank or SEBI/RBI registration; Zero information about MF pledge process; No min/max loan amount guidelines
- **Missing**: Interest rate and partner bank details

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 5/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Hmm, basic KYC screen but where's the information about who's giving me the loan?
> *Critical audit*: As a finance manager, I need to see the lending entity and SEBI/RBI credentials before sharing my PAN. This feels premature.
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone handling finance professionally, I recognize this as a standard KYC screen, but the lack of regulatory credentials is concerning. However, since this is just step 2/5 and PAN verification is a mandatory first step for any financial product, I'll proceed expecting these details in the next screens.
- **Friction points**: No mention of lending partner bank; Missing regulatory credentials; No indication of interest rates yet; No explanation of MF pledge process
- **Missing**: SEBI/RBI registered lending partner details

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: OTP verification is expected, but where's any info about my mutual funds or the lending terms?
> *Critical audit*: No mention of which entity is verifying my phone, no clarity on why this check is needed before showing loan terms
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance professional, I understand OTP verification is a regulatory requirement for KYC. While the interface is clean and professional, the complete absence of lending partner details or MF safety information is concerning. However, since this is only screen 3 and I have a planned need (not urgent), I'll proceed expecting these details in the next steps.
- **Friction points**: No indication of OTP validity period; Zero context about MF pledging process; No mention of lending partner at this stage; No progress indicator showing remaining steps
- **Missing**: A simple line stating which bank/NBFC is verifying my details

**Screen 4** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 4/10 | Clarity: 3/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Wait, where are the actual LAMF rates and terms? They're trying to push a personal loan when I came for LAMF?
> *Critical audit*: No clarity on LAMF terms, no mention of lending partner, mixing personal loan with LAMF feels like a bait-and-switch
- **Decision reasoning**: As a finance manager, I can't proceed without seeing clear LAMF terms and the regulated entity behind this. The attempt to push a personal loan instead of showing LAMF details feels like misdirection. My MF portfolio is too valuable to risk without complete transparency.
- **Drop-off reason**: No transparency on LAMF terms, rates, and lending partner. Screen focuses on personal loan when I specifically want LAMF.
- **Friction points**: No LAMF interest rates shown; No mention of lending partner; Pushing personal loan when I specifically want LAMF; No explanation of MF pledge process; Screen ID showing 'unsecured-primary' is concerning
- **Missing**: Complete LAMF terms, rates and partner bank details

#### Neha Gupta  (❌ Dropped at Screen 4)
- Urgency: planned | LAMF exp: No

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 4/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Hmm, clean interface but where's the interest rate? As a tech person I appreciate the UI but as a first-time LAMF user I need more info before picking an amount.
> *Critical audit*: No mention of how my MF portfolio links to loan eligibility. As an engineer, I need to understand the system's logic before inputting values.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a software engineer, I appreciate the clean UI but am bothered by the lack of technical details and transparency. However, since this is just screen 1 and my renovation need isn't urgent, I'll continue expecting more details in subsequent screens. My Groww portfolio gives me a safety net - I can always back out if terms aren't favorable.
- **Friction points**: No interest rate or processing fee info; No indication if ₹350k is within eligible range; Zero information about MF pledging process; Missing regulatory/bank partnership details
- **Missing**: A clear display of interest rate and eligible loan amount based on my ₹5L portfolio

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Basic KYC screen, but where's the info about my MFs? As a software engineer, I expect better upfront transparency.
> *Critical audit*: No mention of which banks are lending, no SEBI registration visible, and zero info about what happens to my existing SIPs
- **Decision reasoning**: As a tech professional using Groww, I'm comfortable with digital KYC processes. While the interface is clean and familiar, the lack of transparency about MF pledging is concerning. However, since this is just step 2/5 and my need isn't urgent, I'll proceed expecting more details in subsequent screens.
- **Friction points**: No regulatory compliance badges visible; Zero information about the pledge process; No preview of interest rates or terms; Missing partner bank logos or credentials
- **Missing**: A simple process flow diagram showing pledge mechanics and SIP continuity

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP verification, but why isn't there any info about my MFs on this screen? Feels disconnected from the LAMF context.
> *Critical audit*: As a software engineer, I notice there's no mention of what systems or data this OTP verification will grant access to. What permissions am I enabling?
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who works in tech, I understand this is a standard security step, but I'm concerned about the lack of context around what access I'm granting. However, since this is just step 3/5 and I'm not in an emergency rush, I'll continue expecting more detailed information about my MF pledge in the next screens.
- **Friction points**: No context about what happens after OTP verification; Missing explanation of what access I'm granting; No indication of OTP validity period; Zero information about MF portfolio or pledging process
- **Missing**: A clear statement about what systems/data this OTP verification will grant access to

**Screen 4** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 4/10 | Clarity: 3/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Wait, why are they pushing a personal loan when I came for LAMF? And why such a small LAMF amount when my portfolio is worth 5L?
> *Critical audit*: No transparency on LAMF interest rates, unclear pledge terms, and trying to upsell a personal loan I didn't ask for. As a software engineer, I need clear documentation of what I'm signing up for.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a tech professional with a planned renovation need, I require complete transparency about rates and terms. This screen seems to be steering me toward a personal loan I don't want, while offering a surprisingly small LAMF amount against my substantial portfolio. The lack of clear pledge mechanics and interest rates is a deal-breaker.
- **Drop-off reason**: Insufficient transparency about LAMF terms and unexplained low LAMF amount despite higher portfolio value
- **Friction points**: Pushing personal loan when I specifically want LAMF; Offering only 60K against 5L portfolio without explanation; No mention of interest rates or pledge terms; Screen ID visible ('offer-unsecured-primary') feels unprofessional
- **Missing**: Detailed comparison of LAMF vs Personal loan rates and terms

> **Final drop-off**: Insufficient transparency about LAMF terms and unexplained low LAMF amount despite higher portfolio value

#### Kiran Reddy  (❌ Dropped at Screen 4)
- Urgency: opportunistic | LAMF exp: Yes

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Too basic for a repeat user. Where's my max eligible amount? I know this stuff already.
> *Critical audit*: No indication of my portfolio-linked credit limit or interest rates. As a founder who's used LAMF before, I need to see my numbers fast.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a tech founder who's used LAMF before, I expect faster personalization. However, the professional design and quick-select options suggest a legitimate product. I'll continue because I need the funds today, but I expect the next screen to show my actual eligibility based on my ₹7L portfolio.
- **Friction points**: No personalized max eligible amount shown; Interest rates missing entirely; No indication of processing time; Treating me like a first-time user when I'm not
- **Missing**: My portfolio-based maximum eligible credit line

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard KYC screen, let's get this over with quickly. I've done this before.
> *Critical audit*: Why aren't they showing my previous loan history since I've used LAMF before? Could pre-fill this.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user and tech-savvy founder, I know this step is necessary but could be smoother. The clean interface suggests legitimacy, but I'm annoyed they're not leveraging my previous history. Still, this is a standard KYC step, and my urgency level means I'll push through.
- **Friction points**: No recognition of me as a repeat customer; No indication of how many steps left; No preview of credit line despite having my portfolio data
- **Missing**: Quick estimate of my eligible credit line based on linked portfolios

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP screen, let's get this over with. At least it's not asking for unnecessary details.
> *Critical audit*: No indication of OTP expiry time or remaining attempts. As a repeat LAMF user, I expect faster verification methods.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user and tech-savvy founder, this is a necessary but tedious step. The professional UI maintains trust, but I'm eager to see my credit line details. Given my urgency for business funds today, I'll push through despite the basic verification method.
- **Friction points**: No OTP expiry timer shown; No attempt counter visible; Could have used biometric authentication for faster verification
- **Missing**: A progress indicator showing how close I am to seeing my eligible credit line

**Screen 4** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 4/10 | Clarity: 3/10)
> *Gut reaction*: This is wasting my time with a bait-and-switch. I need ₹4.5L, they're showing me ₹1.6L total? And mixing personal loan into my LAMF request?
> *Critical audit*: Why show personal loan when I specifically came for LAMF? My portfolio is worth ₹7L, eligible for ₹5L LAMF, but they're offering only ₹60K against MFs?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a repeat LAMF user with ₹7L portfolio needing ₹4.5L urgently, offering me ₹60K LAMF is almost insulting. I know my portfolio can fetch higher credit. The attempt to push a personal loan instead of maximizing my LAMF eligibility shows misaligned priorities.
- **Drop-off reason**: Severely under-utilizing my MF portfolio value with tiny LAMF offer, while pushing personal loan product I didn't ask for
- **Friction points**: Vastly undersized loan offer vs my portfolio value; Mixing personal loan when I want LAMF; No interest rates shown; No mention of total eligible LAMF amount; Screen ID visible suggests prioritizing unsecured loan
- **Missing**: Maximum eligible LAMF amount based on my ₹7L portfolio

> **Final drop-off**: Severely under-utilizing my MF portfolio value with tiny LAMF offer, while pushing personal loan product I didn't ask for

#### Deepak Nair  (❌ Dropped at Screen 1)
- Urgency: planned | LAMF exp: No

**Screen 1** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 3/10 | Clarity: 4/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Arey, where is all the important information? As a government employee, I need to see proper authorization first.
> *Critical audit*: No SEBI/RBI mention, no bank partner shown, no explanation of what happens to my mutual funds. Too risky to proceed blindly.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a government employee who has never pledged MFs before, I need to see proper authorization and bank partnerships before proceeding. This screen asks for loan amount without first establishing legitimacy or explaining what happens to my mutual funds. I'll rather visit SBI branch where I know it's safe.
- **Drop-off reason**: Insufficient trust signals and no explanation of MF pledging process makes it too risky for first-time LAMF user
- **Friction points**: No mention of regulatory compliance; Zero information about mutual fund safety; Interest rates completely missing; No bank partner logos visible; No explanation of the pledging process
- **Missing**: A clear statement about RBI/SEBI approval and which bank is providing the loan

> **Final drop-off**: Insufficient trust signals and no explanation of MF pledging process makes it too risky for first-time LAMF user

#### Anjali Kapoor  (❌ Dropped at Screen 5)
- Urgency: emergency | LAMF exp: No

**Screen 1** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Where's the safety information? I need to know what happens to my mutual funds before I put in any amount.
> *Critical audit*: No mention of interest rates, no indication if my portfolio qualifies, and most importantly - zero information about MF safety protocols.
- **Decision reasoning**: While I'm nervous about the lack of safety information, my emergency need for ₹1.5L is pushing me forward. The app looks professional enough to continue, but I'll be looking carefully for MF safety details on the next screen. If I don't see it soon, I'm out.
- **Friction points**: No mention of MF safety or pledge process; Interest rates completely missing; No indication if my ₹6L portfolio qualifies; No regulatory badges or bank partnerships shown
- **Missing**: A clear 'Your MFs remain safe' message with SEBI/RBI badges

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 5/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Just PAN and mobile? Where's the information about my mutual fund safety? But I need this loan urgently...
> *Critical audit*: No mention of SEBI registration or bank partnerships. As a school principal, I need more legitimacy signals before sharing my PAN.
- **Decision reasoning**: While I'm very nervous about my MF safety and the lack of trust signals is concerning, my emergency need for ₹1.5L this week is pushing me forward. The clean interface suggests legitimacy, and I know PAN verification is a standard first step. I'll proceed but will be extra vigilant on the next screens.
- **Friction points**: No regulatory credentials visible; Zero information about mutual fund safety; No preview of interest rates or charges; Can't see which banks are involved
- **Missing**: A clear 'Your MFs remain in your demat, we only place a lien' message

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 7/10)
> *Gut reaction*: An OTP check is normal for banking, but where's any mention of my mutual funds? I'm getting more nervous.
> *Critical audit*: Why am I verifying my number before seeing ANY details about how my MFs will be protected? This feels backwards.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a school principal with an emergency need, I understand verification is necessary, and OTP is standard banking practice. While I'm increasingly nervous about my MF safety, I'm pushing through because I need the money this week and the app looks professional enough. But they better explain MF safety on the next screen.
- **Friction points**: No mention of mutual fund safety yet; Missing OTP expiry timer creates uncertainty; Still no interest rates or terms visible
- **Missing**: A simple one-liner about MF safety like 'Your mutual funds remain securely in your demat account'

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 6/10 | Clarity: 4/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Why aren't they showing me the full interest rates? And what exactly happens to my mutual funds?
> *Critical audit*: No clear mention of LAMF terms, safety mechanisms, or what triggers MF liquidation. As a school principal, I need more transparency before risking my savings.
- **Decision reasoning**: Given my emergency need for ₹1.5L, the combined loan option could work perfectly. While I'm nervous about the lack of MF safety details, my immediate requirement and the professional interface are pushing me forward. I'm hoping the next screen will address my concerns about collateral safety.
- **Friction points**: No clear interest rates displayed; Missing MF safety/pledge details; No regulatory mentions or bank partnerships visible; Technical term 'unsecured-primary' in screen name is concerning
- **Missing**: A clear comparison table showing interest rates, processing fees, and MF safety guarantees

**Screen 5** — 🚪 DROP_OFF  (Trust: 4/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Wait, where's the information about my mutual fund safety? I can't just blindly select a loan amount!
> *Critical audit*: No explanation of pledge mechanics, no clarity on MF liquidation rules, and pushing a combo loan without explaining why - this feels rushed and risky
- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user with high collateral anxiety, I need explicit reassurance about my MF safety before selecting any loan option. Despite my emergency need, I can't risk my ₹6L portfolio without understanding the pledge mechanics. The combo loan push without explanation feels like a red flag.
- **Drop-off reason**: No clear information about mutual fund safety and pledge terms at the critical decision point
- **Friction points**: No explanation of MF pledge safety; Pushing combo loan without clear benefits; Missing collateral terms and conditions; No mention of partner bank or regulatory compliance
- **Missing**: Clear explanation of mutual fund safety measures and pledge terms

> *Gut reaction*: Clean interface, but where are the rates? As a repeat LAMF user, I need that info upfront.
> *Critical audit*: No mention of max loan eligibility against my 6L portfolio. Why make me guess?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a PM who's used LAMF before, I know this is just the entry screen. The clean UI suggests a legitimate product, but they're hiding the rates which is annoying. Given my opportunistic need and tech comfort, I'll proceed but expect rate transparency in the next screen.
- **Friction points**: No interest rate visibility upfront; Missing portfolio-based eligibility info; No partner bank or regulatory mentions
- **Missing**: Interest rate and processing fee comparison with traditional banks

**Screen 2** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Basic KYC screen, seen this before in my bank's LAMF. Let's get through this quickly.
> *Critical audit*: No indication of rates or timeline yet, but it's early. As a repeat LAMF user, I know this is standard verification.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a PM who's used LAMF before, I recognize this as a standard verification step. Since I'm not in urgent need and trust fintech platforms, I'm comfortable proceeding without seeing all details upfront. The clean UI suggests a legitimate product.
- **Friction points**: No indication of how many steps remain in the process; Could show my existing portfolio value since I'm on INDmoney; No mention of partner bank or SEBI registration yet
- **Missing**: Timeline indicator showing total steps and estimated approval time

**Screen 3** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Standard OTP flow, similar to my bank. Clean UI, but where's the loan info?
> *Critical audit*: No indication of next steps or what eligibility check entails. As a repeat LAMF user, I expect more transparency about the process.
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, I understand this is a necessary security step. While the UI is clean and professional, I'm starting to get impatient about seeing actual loan terms. However, given my opportunistic timeline and high digital literacy, this standard verification step isn't a dealbreaker.
- **Friction points**: No timer for OTP expiry; No indication of remaining attempts; Zero context about what happens after verification
- **Missing**: A progress indicator showing where I am in the loan approval journey

**Screen 4** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 6/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Hmm, why are they pushing a personal loan when I came for LAMF? Though combining both could work for my needs...
> *Critical audit*: No clear interest rate comparison between personal loan and LAMF. Where are the exact terms for the LAMF portion?
- **Decision reasoning**: As someone who's used LAMF before, I know this is a legitimate product structure, but I need to see the exact rates to compare with my bank's offering. The professional UI and clear amounts keep me engaged, but they're holding back crucial information I need for decision-making.
- **Friction points**: Interest rates not immediately visible; No clear LAMF-specific details; Pushing personal loan when I specifically want LAMF
- **Missing**: Side-by-side comparison of interest rates and processing fees for both options

**Screen 5** — ✅ CONTINUE  (Trust: 7/10 | Clarity: 8/10)
> *Gut reaction*: Clean presentation of options, but why push a combo loan when I only need LAMF? As a repeat LAMF user, this feels like unnecessary upselling.
> *Critical audit*: The LAMF amount offered (₹60,000) is way below my eligible amount based on my ₹6L portfolio. Where's the explanation for this low limit?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a PM who's used LAMF before, I understand the product well enough to proceed despite some red flags. The rates are transparent and competitive, but I'm concerned about the unexplained low LAMF limit. Given my non-urgent need, I'll continue but will carefully review the final terms.
- **Friction points**: No explanation for the low LAMF limit despite higher portfolio value; Pushing combo loan without clear benefits; Missing collateral pledge details at this crucial decision point; No breakdown of processing fees or other charges
- **Missing**: Explanation of why LAMF limit is only ₹60,000 when my portfolio is worth ₹6L

> *Critical audit*: No regulatory information, no lender details, asking for loan amount without showing interest rates or explaining MF pledge process - this feels backwards.
- **Decision reasoning**: At my age and being a first-time LAMF user, I need to see clear legitimacy signals before proceeding. This app is asking me to choose a loan amount without first establishing trust or showing who the lender is. I would prefer to consult my son or break my FD rather than proceed without knowing the regulatory framework.
- **Drop-off reason**: No visible regulatory compliance or bank partnership information on first screen
- **Friction points**: No mention of partner bank or SEBI/RBI regulation; Interest rates not shown upfront; No explanation about MF pledging process; No minimum-maximum loan amount guidelines; Asking for loan amount before showing credentials

> *Critical audit*: No mention of pledge mechanics, interest rates, or regulatory compliance. As a first-time LAMF user, I need more assurance about my MF safety.
- **Decision reasoning**: As a management consultant, I appreciate the clean UX but am concerned about the lack of financial transparency. Since this is a planned need and not urgent, I'll continue but am on high alert for hidden charges. The professional design suggests legitimacy, but I need more trust signals.
- **Friction points**: No mention of interest rates or fees upfront; Missing any indication of MF pledge safety; No regulatory/bank partnership badges visible; Can't see maximum eligible amount based on my portfolio

> *Critical audit*: No mention of which bank is providing the loan. Why do they need PAN before showing basic product details?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user, I'm proceeding because this looks like a standard KYC screen and I'm not in emergency need. However, as a management consultant who values transparency, I'm noting the lack of upfront terms and regulatory credentials. Since my need isn't urgent, I'll give it one more screen to show credibility signals.
- **Friction points**: No mention of partner bank or SEBI/RBI registration; Asking for PAN before showing basic loan terms; Zero information about MF pledge process; No indication of next steps in the process

- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user, I'm proceeding because phone verification is standard for financial apps, and I have time to evaluate (not urgent). However, the lack of any MF safety messaging or basic loan terms at this stage is making me increasingly wary.
- **Friction points**: No mention of MF safety or pledge process; Still haven't seen any loan terms or rates; Missing timer for OTP expiry; No regulatory trust signals visible
- **Missing**: A simple line saying 'Your mutual funds remain secure during verification' would help ease anxiety

> *Critical audit*: No clear rates shown for either loan type, trying to upsell a higher-rate personal loan, and where's the detailed LAMF terms I need?
- **Decision reasoning**: As a first-time LAMF user specifically looking for MF-backed credit, this screen's focus on personal loans feels deceptive. I need clear terms and safety assurances before pledging my MFs, and this screen provides neither. Since my need isn't urgent, I'd rather explore other apps or lenders who are more transparent about LAMF terms.
- **Drop-off reason**: Lack of transparency about LAMF terms and attempt to redirect towards personal loan suggests hidden charges or unfavorable terms. As a planned borrower, I have time to find a more straightforward option.
- **Friction points**: Personal loan being pushed as primary option; No interest rates shown for either option; Zero information about LAMF terms and collateral safety; Hidden processing fees and charges; Screen ID suggesting 'unsecured-primary' feels manipulative
- **Missing**: Detailed comparison table showing rates, terms, and processing fees for both LAMF and personal loan options
